# Hey, I’m Pratham

I’m a reverse engineer, low-level programmer, and exploit developer who loves breaking binaries apart and understanding how they tick. Most of my projects revolve around:

- ## Malware Reverse Engineering – digging into samples, studying behaviors, and building tools to make analysis easier.  
- System-level Exploitation – buffer overflows, heap tricks, kernel drivers, and custom challenges.  
- Binary Tools – packers, ELF/DLL analyzers, and sandboxes to safely run untrusted code.  
- Game & Mobile Internals – JNI hooks, native library tracing, and experiments with Android.  

I like building small but sharp tools – things that make CTFs, reversing, and security research more practical and fun.  

Currently working on:  
- A lightweight ELF sandbox with `seccomp`, `ptrace`, and `chroot`.  
- Custom hooking frameworks for Android native libraries.  
- Exploitation practice with QEMU and weird architectures (MIPS/ARM).  

When I’m not coding, I’m probably breaking something in a VM, setting up CTF infra for my team **pwn0rDi3**, or learning something new at the assembly/kernel level.
